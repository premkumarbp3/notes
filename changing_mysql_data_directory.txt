Changing Mariadb data directory on Ubuntu 18.04:
1. stop service:
sudo systemctl stop mysql
2. copy the existing database directory to the new location with rsync
sudo rsync -avzh /var/lib/mysql /database/

3. Once the rsync is complete, rename the current folder with a .bak extension and keep it until weâ€™ve confirmed the move was successful.
sudo mv /var/lib/mysql /var/lib/mysql.bak

4. Now edit the mysql configuration file to reflect new location:
sudo vim /etc/mysql/my.cnf
datadir=/database/mysql

5. Allow AppArmor to let MySQL write to the new directory by creating an alias between the default directory and the new location. To do this, edit the AppArmor alias file
sudo vim /etc/apparmor.d/tunables/alias
alias /var/lib/mysql/ -> /database/mysql/,

6. restart AppArmor:
sudo systemctl restart apparmor

7. To start the mysql server, we will create the minimal directory structure to pass the script's environment check:
sudo mkdir /var/lib/mysql/mysql -p

8. Now we're ready to start MySQL.
sudo systemctl start mysql
