Before Setup shared cluster we must know the elements.
They are:
    mongos                 --> query Router
    configuration Server   --> it stores meta data about shard.
    shard                 --> it store the real data, but it splits data and store it into shard replicaset.

this setup needs minimum 11 servers for production.
it have three replicasets, each have 3 machines.
1 replica set for configuration server (meta data)
1 replica set for shard1 (application data)
1 replica set for shard2 (application data)
2 servers for mongos
