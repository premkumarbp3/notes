install postgresql using below command:
   sudo apt install postgresql
             or
   brew instal postgresql@15

create application database

   # create database myapplication

create separate user for your application.
   # create user myappuser with encrypted password 'password';
   # grant all privileges on database myapplication to myappuser;

in postgres 15 need to do one more step to allow application user to write on application database.
execute command as super user i.e using postgres user.
   # \c myapplication
   # GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO myappuser;
